				All the files required for this workshop are available on GitHub here:
				<a href="https://github.com/michaelkerry/bootstrap_wksp" target="_blank">https://github.com/michaelkerry/bootstrap_wksp</a>
			</p>

			<h4>Easiest</h4>
			<p>If you are *not* already comfortable with GitHub, the easiest thing to do is to download the zipped directory of all files 
				<a href="https://github.com/michaelkerry/bootstrap_wksp/archive/gh-pages.zip" target="_blank">here</a>. You can then edit them
				with your favored IDE/Text Editor.
			</p>
						
			<h4>Moderately challenging</h4>
			<p>If you *are* already comfortable with GitHub, and have a preferred IDE/Text Editor, please feel free to 
				<a href="https://github.com/michaelkerry/bootstrap_wksp#fork-destination-box" target="_blank">fork the project</a>  
				and clone it to your local machine, then edit the exercises	with your favored IDE/Text Editor.</p>
			
			<h4>For the Brave of Heart: Set up new GitHub account and use Aptana 3 Studio</h4>
			<p>
				If you would like to try something new, and are confident in your abilities, you may wish to try using Aptana 3 Studio to complete this project. 
				Aptana 3 Studio is an IDE based on Eclipse but oriented towards HTML and Ruby development instead of Java or C development. 
				I used Aptana 3 Studio to develop the materials for this workshop and commit them to the bootstrap_wskp repository on GitHub.
				The most challenging part of this process may be setting up the SSH keys required to connect your local machine to GitHub. 
				You will want to try to get this set up beforehand, as we won't have time to debug these issues during the workshop.
			</p>
				
			<p>
				You will need a GitHub acccount. If you do not already have one, please sign up here: 
				<a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">Github Home</a>
			</p>
			
			<p>Once you have one, please follow the <a href="https://github.com/settings/ssh">instructions to set up ssh keys</a> on your working machine and share them with GitHub,
				 so that you can fork and clone the project to your working machine.
			</p>

			<p>Download and install <a href="http://www.aptana.com/products/studio3/download.html" target="_blank">Aptana Studio 3</a>, 
				which IMHO has easy-to-use Git integration already built in. You may wish to change the default workspace.</p>
				
			<p>If you are using Aptana 3 studio, you can fork and clone the project from GitHub by clicking on the 'File' menubar, then selecting 'Import',
				 then opening the 'Git' directory, then selecting 'Fork GitHub Repository'. You will then need to enter 'michaelkerry' as the owner, 
				 'bootstrap_wksp' for the repository, and then select a valid file path for the destination (in the current workspace is best) </p>
